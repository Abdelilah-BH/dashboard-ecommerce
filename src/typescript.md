# TypeScript Tutorial.
* My name is abdelilah bouhou and i will be your instructor in this course.
Now this course is about typescript superset 2 javascript so a programing language which actually builds up on javascript.
</br>
* you will see in this course you can write less error prone much better and cleaner code and also use some exciting new features which don't exist like this in javascrit.
</br>
* Now in this course you will learn typescript from scratch.
</br>
* You don't need anything about typescript to get started basic javascript knowledge absolutley suffices.
</br>
* You will learn all the basics of typescript.
    * How it works?
    * Why we use it?
    * The different?
</br>
* we'll dive into the core types it provides and we'll gradually build up knowledge and dive into more and more advanced typescript features for all at this course.

1. What is Typescript?
```
Typescript is a javascript superset. Now what that is mean, It means that typescript is in the end a language a programming language building up on javascript it's not a brand new language instead it takes the javascript language and adds new features and advantages to it. It makes writing javascript code easier and more powerful.
You could say but we have one huge disadvantage typescript can't be executed by javascript environments like the browsers can't execute typescript and for example node JS. also can't execute typescript so the environements where we can execute javascript don't support typescript.
what's the idea behind typescript then it's a better version of javascript and we can't use it. Well not quite typescript is a programming language but it's also a tool. It's a powerful compiler which you run over your code to compile your typescript code to javascript. So what you get as a result when you writing code typescript is javascript but you didn't write that javascript code you wrote typescript code with all the new features and all the advatages and you get normal javascript code

```
2. Why TypeScript?
```
```
function add(firstNumber, secondNumber) {
    return firstNumber + secondNumber;
}
console.log(add('1'+'1'));
```
In this example we're calling this function with two strings and as a result you would actually get here is probably an unwanted behavior because if you add two strings javascript will come concatinate the strings instead of doing a mathematical calculation here So the result would no be 2 but 11 concatenated string of the two numbers.
This is an error you could have in javascript is not a thechnical error you probably won't get a runtime error but you have a logical mistake in your code and that of course can lead to huge problems in the web applications you're writing with javascript and thankfully this is possible with typescript because developers can write code here and introduce bugs like in javascript and with typescript we have a tool that helps us write better code and avoid such problems.
